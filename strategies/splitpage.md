# Split Page Method

This technique has been compared with the Cornell Method but there is a difference in the core structure of these two types of notes. As the name suggests, you divide the page vertically into two sections; the main and secondary ideas. The best thing about taking notes in this way is that you make the most out of your study time by taking notes and organizing them simultaneously.
