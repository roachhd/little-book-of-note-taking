# Visual Aids

Visual study aids can help you build a set of supernotes to improve the natural way your brain processes new information. A quick way to do this would be to create a mind map online to make connections, develop ideas and unleash your creativity. The ExamTime Mind Map tool allows you to move the information into a note with a single click to make note-taking an even faster practice.
